# Button State Plugin

This is my first attempt at making a plugin for Obsidian, and using TypeScript.

The idea is to make buttons that will change color based on some conditions set by the user. One use case is to utilize these buttons to visually track whether a task has been done recently.

Could this have been accomplished with the [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin? Yes, and that's exactly what I've intially done with a separate js script and utilizing the `dv.view()` function. 

And while you can also add in customizability in that js script, it'd be nice to have user interface to do that as well! :)
